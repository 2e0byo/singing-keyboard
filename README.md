# A silly program to play notes when keys are bashed

This is a heartily silly program, designed to amuse my daughter, who was bashing
keys on the keyboard and clearly wanted something to happen.  Now something
does.

## Building

Clone this repo and run `cargo build`

## Using

Run `cargo run` and then bash keys.  Random notes will be played.  Press Ctrl-C to exit.
